# Image-Colorization

This repository contains a deep learning–based Image Colorization project.  
The goal of the project is to convert black-and-white / grayscale images into realistic color images using neural network models.

### 🎯 Project Objectives
- Automatically add color to grayscale images using computer vision
- Learn and implement convolutional neural networks for image-to-image translation
- Evaluate the quality of generated images based on visual similarity

### 🧠 Key Concepts
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Encoder–decoder / Autoencoder architecture
- Transfer learning (e.g., VGG, ResNet) — if applicable
- Image preprocessing, normalization, and LAB/RGB color space conversion

### 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch (specify whichever used)
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Matplotlib

### 📌 Workflow
1. Input grayscale images
2. Preprocessing and dataset preparation
3. Training deep learning model for colorization
4. Generating and visualizing colorized images

### 🚀 Features
- Supports inference on custom grayscale images
- Fully automated colorization pipeline
- Trained on large-scale image datasets (mention dataset if applicable)

### 📂 Repository Contents
- Source code / model script
- Dataset links (optional)
- Trained model weights (if uploaded)
- Output folder with sample results

📍 **Future Scope**
- GAN-based colorization for enhanced realism
- Training with domain-specific datasets (old photos, portraits, anime, etc.)
- Integration with a web/mobile interface
